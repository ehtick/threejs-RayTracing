A real-time path tracer that runs entirely in the browser. Rayzee combines a WebGPU wavefront Monte Carlo core, a two-level BVH, and TSL shaders compiled to WGSL to deliver physically based global illumination with interactive frame rates.

🌐 **[Launch App](https://atul-mourya.github.io/RayTracing/)**

The project is a monorepo with two packages: **`rayzee/`** — the standalone rendering engine, publishable to npm — and **`app/`** — the React UI built on top of it. External clients can use the engine independently:

```js
import { PathTracerApp } from 'rayzee';
```

See **[rayzee/README.md](rayzee/README.md)** for the full engine API reference — installation, framework integration, managers, events, and custom pipeline stages.

## Highlights

- **Wavefront path tracer** — decomposed `generate → extend → shade → compact` compute kernels with stream compaction, driving a Monte Carlo core with configurable multi-bounce transport and progressive accumulation
- **Two-level BVH** — SAH-built TLAS/BLAS acceleration structure, constructed off the main thread via Web Workers so scene loads don't block rendering, with O(N) refit for animated and transformed geometry
- **Instanced geometry** — a geometry used by several objects is stored once in its own space and placed by matrix, so a scene of repeated furniture costs one copy rather than one per placement; geometry used once, or geometry that emits light, is baked to world space instead so rays skip the transform entirely
- **Real-time + final-quality denoising** — ASVGF spatiotemporal filtering for interactive navigation, a lighter spatial-only edge-aware à-trous filter when temporal reuse is unwanted, and Intel Open Image Denoise (OIDN) for clean final renders or as the live viewport denoiser (fed a reprojected motion history while the view moves, which roughly halves its boiling), running as a native WGSL U-Net on the renderer's own GPU device with FP16 inference where the hardware allows
- **Neural upscaling** — a finished render can be enlarged 2x or 4x by Real-ESRGAN rather than traced at full size. It runs once, when the render completes, on the denoised result
- **HDR image-based lighting** with CDF importance sampling for accurate, noise-efficient environment illumination
- **Full PBR material pipeline** with live, real-time editing of materials, camera, depth of field, and environment — no re-render required to see a change
- **Depth of field** with photographic controls (focal length, aperture, focus distance) and click-to-focus
- **360° equirectangular panorama** camera projection, with longitude/latitude range cropping and a level-horizon option
- **Fast Navigation** — renders at lower resolution while the camera moves and restores full quality the moment you stop, keeping navigation responsive
- **Broad asset support** — GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ, STL, PLY, DAE, 3MF, and USDZ models; HDR/EXR environments; ZIP archives with automatic model detection
- **Scenes larger than memory** — a pbrt-v4 archive of tens of gigabytes can be inspected without unpacking it and loaded one element at a time; triangle and node storage is chunked past the browser's ~2 GB single-array ceiling, and a CPU memory preflight refuses a scene that would kill the tab rather than letting it die mid-build
- **OpenColorIO colour management** — opens in Blender 5.1's own config (AgX, Medium High Contrast), with its views, looks and displays, ACES configs, or a studio's own config folder; render in ACEScg or another working space, set per-texture colour spaces, and save EXR in a delivery space. The default look ships pre-built, so the first frame needs neither the colour runtime nor its download. Exposure in stops, with automatic exposure
- **Blender-accurate shading** — exact Fresnel on glass, paint and plastic, sharp highlights at their true peak, scale-aware ray start points so light does not leak out of small crevices, and Cycles' shadow-terminator offset for low-poly curved meshes; a glossy black sphere matches Cycles within 1 % at every angle

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js >= 20.19.0 and a browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Safari 18+, or Firefox 141+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atul-mourya/RayTracing.git
cd RayTracing
npm install        # installs both rayzee/ and app/ workspaces
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5173
```

```bash
npm run build          # build engine + app
npm run build:engine   # rayzee engine only (ESM + UMD)
npm run build:app      # React app only
npm run preview        # preview the production build
```

```bash
npm test               # Vitest unit tests
npm run bench          # headless-GPU quality, memory, and perf regression suite
npm run bench:bless    # regenerate goldens — required once on a new machine
```

Bench baselines are machine-specific and the suite refuses to compare across a mismatched GPU fingerprint. See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) for the scene corpus and the individual suites.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Toggle rendering pause/play |
| `W` / `E` | Translate / rotate the transform gizmo (when an object is selected) |
| `R` | Scale the gizmo (object selected) — otherwise resets the camera to its default position |
| `Esc` | Deselect current object |

## Usage

Drag and drop a model (GLB, GLTF, FBX, OBJ, STL, PLY, DAE, 3MF, USDZ — or a ZIP containing one) onto the canvas, or pick from the built-in model and HDRI library. Adjust samples, bounces, and denoising in the Path Tracer panel, the look in its Color Management group (Tone Mapping, Style, Screen, Exposure, Save EXR), edit PBR materials directly on selected objects, and switch between Interactive and Production render modes as you work. Completed renders are saved to a local results gallery for review and export.

The Denoising panel also carries the **AI Upscaler**, which delivers an image larger than the one traced (Real-ESRGAN, 2x or 4x). It needs **Final Denoise (OIDN)** on, which is the default; without it the upscaler works on noise and does more harm than good, so its switch stays disabled until it is.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full walkthrough and development workflow.

## Headless rendering

The engine renders without a screen — and without a person to notice when something goes wrong. `renderHeadless()` is the supported entry point:

```js
import { renderHeadless } from 'rayzee';

const shot = await renderHeadless( {
	canvas,                            // needed for the WebGPU surface, not for output
	model: 'https://cdn/scene.glb',
	width: 1920, height: 1080,
	samples: 256,
} );
// shot.data — RGBA bytes straight from the storage target. No canvas, no compositor.
```

Its defaults are the batch renderer's rather than the viewer's. All three are reversible; none can be turned off by accident:

| option | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strict` | `true` | throws at the point of degradation instead of rendering around it |
| `profile` | `'physical'` | drops viewer tuning — the glTF area-light damping |
| `deterministic` | `true` | pins every clock- and readback-dependent input, so N samples reproduce bit-for-bit |

With `strict: false` the same degradations are recorded instead of thrown: read `app.issues`, or subscribe to `EngineEvents.ISSUE`. A non-empty `app.issueErrors` means *do not publish this frame*. Codes (`ISSUE_CODES`) are add-only API surface.

Three more things a caller with no screen tends to need: `settings.getEffective()` returns every setting in force with its provenance (default, host, scene metadata, or mode preset), `app.adapterInfo.isSoftware` flags a software rasterizer rendering correctly and ~100× slower, and `openHeadless()` returns a live app — which you dispose yourself — when you want several frames from one scene.

## Architecture

Rayzee runs an event-driven, stage-based render pipeline: a wavefront `PathTracer` core feeds `NormalDepth`, `MotionVector`, `ASVGF`, `Variance`, `BilateralFilter`, `EdgeFilter`, `AutoExposure`, and a terminal `Compositor` stage, each communicating through a shared `PipelineContext` and event bus rather than direct references. The engine (`rayzee/`) is fully decoupled from the UI — it's consumable standalone via `import { PathTracerApp } from 'rayzee'` — while the React app (`app/`) wires engine events into Zustand stores.

For the full stage breakdown and shader architecture, see [docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/PATH_TRACER_SHADER_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/PATH_TRACER_SHADER_ARCHITECTURE.md).
