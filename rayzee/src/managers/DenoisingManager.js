//
// Only refreshes taken WHILE MOVING count: that is a different regime, because the render loop
// stops tracing frames nobody will see (skipsTrace) and hands the GPU to the denoise. Measured

// without, so a still-camera timing would rule out navigation that in fact works.
//
// Taken as the MINIMUM, not the median, and reset for each move. The first refresh of a move is
