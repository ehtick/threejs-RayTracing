# Rayzee Real-Time Path Tracer - AI Coding Instructions

## Overview
**Rayzee** is a sophisticated real-time path tracing web application built with Three.js, React, and a WebGPU renderer. The core rendering pipeline implements Monte Carlo path tracing with BVH acceleration, progressive denoising, and adaptive sampling — running in the browser via TSL (Three Shading Language) shaders compiled to WGSL.

## Architecture Overview

### Modern Event-Driven Pipeline (`rayzee/src/Pipeline/`)
**Recently refactored from pass-based to stage-based architecture**:
- **`RenderPipeline.js`**: Orchestrates stage execution order with shared context and event bus
- **`RenderStage.js`**: Base class for all rendering stages (replaces Three.js Pass pattern)
- **`PipelineContext.js`**: Shared state, textures, and uniforms between stages
- **`EventDispatcher.js`**: Loose coupling via events (e.g., `pathtracer:frameComplete`, `asvgf:reset`)

### Core Rendering Stages (`rayzee/src/Stages/`)
**Execution order matters** - stages run sequentially:
- **`PathTracer.js`** + **`PathTracerStage.js`**: Monte Carlo wavefront path tracing with MRT outputs. `PathTracer` owns the per-frame kernel dispatch; `PathTracerStage` is the shared base holding uniforms, scene buffers and lifecycle.
- **`ASVGF.js`**: Real-time spatiotemporal denoising
- **`NRD.js`**: Port of NVIDIA's ReBLUR recurrent-blur denoiser
- **`EdgeFilter.js`**: Spatial-only edge-aware à-trous filter
- **`Variance.js`** / **`MotionVector.js`** / **`NormalDepth.js`**: G-buffer and reprojection inputs the denoisers read
- **`AutoExposure.js`** / **`Compositor.js`**: Exposure, tone mapping and the final composite
- **`OverlayManager.js`** + **`helpers/TileHelper.js`** (in `managers/`): Unified overlay system — tile borders rendered on a 2D canvas overlay, never baked into saved images

### TSL Shader Modules (`rayzee/src/TSL/`)
33 TSL files using `Fn()`, `If()`, `Loop()`, `.toVar()`:
- Wavefront kernels: `GenerateKernel.js`, `ExtendKernel.js`, `ShadeKernel.js`, `CompactKernel.js`, `FinalWriteKernel.js`
- Traversal and shading: `BVHTraversal.js`, `MaterialSampling.js`, `MaterialTransmission.js`, `Environment.js`
- Lighting: `LightsDirect.js`, `LightsSampling.js`, `EmissiveSampling.js`, `LightBVHSampling.js`, `ShadowTerminator.js`, etc.
- Hit data: `HitFacet.js` — the facet normal (and terminator lift) Extend packs into the hit record

### Colour Management (`rayzee/src/Color/`)
`app.color` is an OpenColorIO pipeline — input colour spaces, the working space, views/looks/displays,
and export — inert until a host loads a config. The host supplies the OCIO runtime
(`configureAssets({ ocioRuntimeFactory })`); the engine never imports it. Load and unload through
`app.loadColorConfig()` / `app.unloadColorConfig()`. Views are baked to tables in one registry
(`ViewTransforms.js`) that the canvas, both readbacks and the menu share; an OCIO view returns
display-encoded colour. The app opens in Blender 5.1's config, shown on the first frame from a
pre-baked view (`saveBakedView` / `loadBakedView`, `npm run color:bake`).

### Multi-Threading Architecture (`rayzee/src/Processor/Workers/`)
Critical for maintaining 60fps during heavy computations:
- **`BVHWorker.js`**: Off-main-thread BVH construction using SAH splitting with treelet optimization
- **`TexturesWorker.js`**: Batch texture processing with memory-optimized chunking
- **`BVHSubtreeWorker.js`**: BVH subtree optimization for GPU traversal
- **`CDFWorker.js`**: CDF computation for environment importance sampling

### State Management (`app/src/store.js`)
Zustand-based stores with **automatic 3D engine synchronization**:
- `usePathTracerStore` - Rendering parameters with handlers that use `getApp()` from appProxy
- `useAssetsStore` - Model/environment loading state
- `useCameraStore` - Camera controls with DOF presets
- Pattern: `handleChange()` utility creates handlers that update both store state and 3D engine, triggering `app.reset()` for immediate visual feedback

### Data Layout & GPU Optimization
**Triangle Data Layout** (20 u32 lanes per triangle = 80 B, 5 vec4s). The buffer is bound as
`uvec4`, so a reader binds `'uvec4'` and floats come back through `uintBitsToFloat`:
```js
// rayzee/src/EngineDefaults.js - TRIANGLE_DATA_LAYOUT
FLOATS_PER_TRIANGLE: 20         // 5 vec4s; each position carries its own normal
POSITION_A/B/C_OFFSET: 0/4/8    // f32 xyz, normal packed in the spare .w lane
NORMAL_A/B/C_PACKED_OFFSET: 3/7/11  // octahedral snorm16, ~0.005° worst case
UV_AB_OFFSET: 12, UV_C_OFFSET: 16   // f32
MATERIAL_FLAGS_OFFSET: 18       // materialIndex | side << 24 | shadowBlockerBits << 26
MESH_INDEX_OFFSET: 19
```
⚠️ Geometry storage is hybrid. A geometry used by several objects stays in **object space** and
the ray is moved into it on entry; a geometry used once — or one that emits light — is **baked to
world space**. Any new reader of the triangle buffer must bind `uvec4` **and** take the hit's
`instanceLeaf`, or it will read object-space positions as though they were world space.

⚠️ The hit record's `normal` is the **interpolated** vertex normal, not the facet's. Spawned rays are
offset with `offsetRayOrigin( p, n )` along the **facet** normal (packed into the hit record by
`HitFacet.js`): offsetting along the interpolated one left pass-through rays inside foliage cards
whose normals point up, and the cards drew black.

## Key Development Patterns

### Event-Driven Stage Communication
**Critical**: Stages communicate via events, not direct coupling:
```js
// PathTracer emitting events
this.eventBus.emit('pathtracer:frameComplete', { frame, samples });
this.eventBus.emit('asvgf:reset');
this.eventBus.emit('tile:changed', { tileX, tileY });

// ASVGFStage listening for events
this.eventBus.on('pathtracer:frameComplete', this.handlePathTracerComplete.bind(this));
this.eventBus.on('asvgf:reset', this.resetTemporalData.bind(this));
```

### Pipeline Context Texture Sharing
**Automatic texture passing** via context (no manual references):
```js
// Stage publishes outputs to context
context.setTexture('pathtracer:color', this.colorTarget.texture);
context.setTexture('pathtracer:normalDepth', this.normalDepthTarget.texture);

// Downstream stages read from context
const pathTracerColor = context.getTexture('pathtracer:color');
const adaptiveSampling = context.getTexture('adaptiveSampling:output');
```

### Progressive Rendering Modes
Three distinct rendering configurations:
- **Interactive** (`INTERACTIVE_STATE`): Low samples (1 SPP, 3 bounces) for real-time navigation
- **Final** (`FINAL_STATE`): High quality (1 SPP, 20 bounces, tiled rendering)
- **Results**: Paused rendering for image viewing/editing

Mode switching via `handleConfigureFor[Mode]()` methods that batch-update uniforms and reset the pipeline.

### State-Engine Synchronization Pattern
**Critical**: All UI state changes must sync with the app via `getApp()`:
```js
// app/src/store.js - handleChange pattern
import { getApp } from '@/lib/appProxy';

const handleChange = (setter, appUpdater, needsReset = true) => val => {
    setter(val);
    const app = getApp();
    if (app) {
        appUpdater(val);
        needsReset && app.reset();  // Triggers immediate re-render
    }
};
```
Always use `getApp()` from appProxy to access the app instance. Never use store setters directly for render parameters — always use provided handlers like `handleBouncesChange`, `handleSamplesChange`.

### Denoising Pipeline Coordination
**Temporal filtering coordination**:
- One denoiser owns the live view (None / EdgeAware / ASVGF / NRD / OIDN); OIDN's final pass on the finished image is a separate switch
- EdgeAware filtering disabled when ASVGF enabled
- Quality presets in `ASVGF_QUALITY_PRESETS` (performance/balanced/quality)

### Asset Processing Workflow
1. **AssetLoader** loads GLB/GLTF models with automatic camera extraction
2. **GeometryExtractor** converts meshes to optimized triangle data (32-float layout)
3. **BVHBuilder** constructs acceleration structure (Web Worker)
4. **TextureCreator** generates GPU textures for materials, triangles, BVH data

## Development Commands

### Essential Development Workflow
```bash
npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run lint        # ESLint with React Compiler plugin
npm run lint-fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run build       # Production build with shader bundling
```

### Debug Visualizations (visMode uniform)
Access via Path Tracer tab → Debug Mode:
- `1-2`: BVH traversal statistics (triangle/box tests)
- `3`: Ray distance visualization  
- `4`: Surface normals
- `6`: Environment map luminance heat map
- `7`: Environment importance sampling PDF

### Performance Profiling
The engine emits an `EngineEvents.FRAME` event every `animate()` tick. Hosts attach their own stats panel (e.g. `stats-gl`) — the app does this in `app/src/components/layout/Viewports/StatsPanel.jsx`. Other built-in profiling signals:
- Triangle intersection counters in shaders
- BVH construction timings with treelet optimization metrics
- Memory usage tracking for texture arrays
- Progressive rendering convergence monitoring

## Critical Implementation Details

### Pipeline Architecture 
**Event-driven stages** replace legacy pass system - stages run in explicit order with loose coupling via events and shared context. See `docs/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for details.

### Memory Management
Web Workers handle large data processing with chunked allocation:
```js
// TexturesWorker.js pattern
const MEMORY_LIMITS = {
    MAX_BYTES_PER_TEXTURE: 256 * 1024 * 1024,  // 256MB chunks
    ADAPTIVE_CHUNK_SIZE: true                   // Dynamic based on texture dimensions
}
```

### Shader Data Access Pattern
Materials and BVH data accessed via texture lookups in TSL:
```js
// Standard pattern in TSL shaders
const getDatafromDataTexture = Fn(([tex, texSize, stride, sampleIndex, dataOffset]) => { ... })
```

### Camera & DOF System
Photography-inspired presets (`CAMERA_PRESETS`) for portrait/landscape/macro with proper focal length calculations. Focus picking via click-to-focus interaction mode.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

1. **Store Updates**: Always use provided handlers (e.g., `handleBouncesChange`) rather than direct setters — they sync with the app via `getApp()`
2. **App Access**: Always use `getApp()` from `@/lib/appProxy` to access the app instance
3. **TSL Hot Reload**: TSL shader changes hot-reload normally via Vite
4. **Worker Data Transfer**: Use transferable objects for large arrays to avoid main thread blocking
5. **BVH Memory**: Large models may require treelet optimization (`treeletOptimization: true`) for performance
6. **Resolution Scaling**: Path tracer resolution independent of UI — use `updateResolution(scale, index)` (2-arg signature)
7. **React Compiler**: Uses React Compiler plugin — avoid manual memoization patterns that conflict with automatic optimization

## Testing & Validation
- Visual testing via built-in debug modes and example scenes
- Performance monitoring through stats display and console timings  
- Memory validation via browser dev tools during large asset loading
- Convergence verification using progressive rendering sample counts

The codebase prioritizes real-time interactivity while maintaining path tracing quality through intelligent LOD systems, progressive refinement, and GPU-optimized data structures.
